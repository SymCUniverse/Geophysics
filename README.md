## SymC Geophysics: Stability Architecture in Fault Dynamics, Magmatic Systems, and Lithospheric Regulation

This repository contains the SymC research program applied to geophysics and planetary behavior. Here, the universal critical-damping boundary (χ = γ/2|ω|) defines the stability architecture of fault systems, magmatic transport, lithospheric stress accumulation, and planetary-scale homeostasis.

The SymC framework models geological processes as adaptive systems that oscillate between underdamped (instability, slip, eruption) and overdamped (rigidity, locking, stagnation) regimes. The χ-window that governs biological and quantum stability also constrains frictional interfaces, tectonic loading cycles, and crust–mantle relaxation processes.

### Included Papers
- **Planetary Physiology (v3):** A unifying model of lithospheric homeostasis and failure geometry.  
- **SymC Seismic Dynamics:** χ-governed state variables for fault slip, stick–slip onset, and rupture timing.  
- **Cross-domain infrastructure:** Inheritance rules linking geological substrates to biological and cosmic systems.

### Key Contributions
- A χ-based stability law governing seismic cycles and crustal relaxation  
- A physical substrate model linking elastic, viscous, and plastic regimes  
- Predictive architecture for slip onset, rupture nucleation, and magmatic ascent  
- A unifying principle connecting geophysics to biological, economic, and cosmic adaptive systems  

### Purpose of the Repository
This repository organizes all SymC geophysical work into one accessible structure, enabling researchers to explore:
- seismic state variables  
- frictional stability transitions  
- lithospheric stress inheritance  
- magmatic flow dynamics  
- planetary-scale homeostatic regulation  

All work is open-access, cross-referenced, and structured for reproducible theoretical development.
